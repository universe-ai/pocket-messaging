# pocket-messaging

Don't just `JSON.stringify` and send your data, use pocket-messaging to pack and send it to a trusted peer.

It is extracted as a standalone project from the universe-ai/core-js project and can be used on its own together with the `pocket-sockets` library.

It handshakes using public-key cryptography and can add an additional layer of encryption to the communication on top of TLS, if needed (for example when TLS termination is provided as a service or not available at all).

## Current status
*!!The Handshake process is not yet secure!!*

Examples and documentation will be added.

## License
This project is released under the MIT license.
